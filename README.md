# Clustering Optimal K Analysis :bar_chart:

This repository contains the implementation of k-means clustering, silhouette analysis, and fuzzy c-means algorithms to cluster a given dataset and find the optimal value of 'k'. The repository also includes the calculation of the J (objective function) value when c is set to the optimal 'k' . The fuzzy c-means algorithm assumes m=2 and beta=0.3 :cloud:.

## Data :file_folder:

The dataset used for clustering can be found at the following link: [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0zx-cXze6ja777SN_NkMYVCzidU2lXw/view?usp=sharing) 

## Usage :computer:

1. Download the dataset from the provided link and save it locally.
2. Load the dataset into the program environment and preprocess it if required.
3. Implement the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster the data and find the optimal value of 'k'.
4. Perform silhouette analysis to evaluate the quality of the clustering results.
5. Implement the fuzzy c-means algorithm with the specified parameters (m=2, beta=0.3) and calculate the J value when c is set to the optimal 'k'.

## Results :chart_with_downwards_trend:

The program will generate the following results:

- The optimal value of 'k' determined using k-means clustering and silhouette analysis.
- Silhouette scores for different values of 'k' to assess the quality of clustering.
- The J value when c is set to the optimal 'k' for the fuzzy c-means algorithm.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contribute to the repository :raised_hands:.
